# Tailwind CSS Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of mini projects built using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and plain HTML. These projects serve as a refresher for my Tailwind CSS knowledge and demonstrate how to create responsive and modern UIs using the utility-first CSS framework.

## Projects
1. **Email Subscription Card**
    A simple and elegant email subscription card designed to capture user email addresses.
2. **Pricing Cards**
    A set of pricing cards showcasing different subscription plans, including details on features and pricing.
3. **Product Modal**
    A responsive product modal designed to display product details and images, suitable for e-commerce applications.

## Tech
- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the web pages.
- **Tailwind CSS CDN**: For styling the projects with a utility-first approach. The CDN version of Tailwind CSS is used for simplicity and ease of integration.

## Usage
Each project is contained in its respective folder. Open the `.html` files in your browser to view the projects.
